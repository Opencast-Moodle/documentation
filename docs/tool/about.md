# Opencast API plugin

The Opencast API plugin provides API functions as general settings for the other plugins. The tool stores the relation between courses and series ids and offers webservice endpoints for the [opencast role provider](https://docs.opencast.org/develop/admin/#configuration/security.user.moodle/).

The Opencast API plugin is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/Opencast-Moodle/moodle-tool_opencast/releases) as well as from the [Moodle plugins directory](https://moodle.org/plugins/tool_opencast).
