# Settings

For the Opencast filter to work you need to configure [LTI](https://docs.opencast.org/develop/admin/#modules/ltimodule/) in your Opencast server.

The configuration options are:

* **Consumer key:** The LTI consumer key.
* **Consumer secret:** The LTI consumer secret.
* **URL of the Opencast Engage server:** The full URL of your Opencast presentation server. For example: `https://develop.opencast.org`
* **URL of the Opencast player:** Relative URL of the Opencast player, e.g. `/paella/ui/watch.html` or `/theodul/ui/core.html`.

Once you configured the filter you need to activate the filter.
