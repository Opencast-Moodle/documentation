# Opencast-Moodle Usergroup documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the Opencast-Moodle Usergroup.

## Communication

For the communication within the community there are two mediums:

* [Mailinglist on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/opencast.org/forum/#!forum/moodle-opencast): moodle-opencast@opencast.org
* Telegram: To join ask for a link on the mailinglist

## Meetings

The meetings take place every second month on the first wednesday of the month. The meeting is at 3pm (in Germany) in [Big Blue Button](https://opencast.blindsidenetworks.net/) (password: welcome).

The minutes are in the [wiki](https://github.com/Opencast-Moodle/documentation/wiki/Meeting-minutes).

## Documentation

The documentation has been build using `mkdocs` and for the theme `mkdocs-windmill` needs to be installed.

This is done automatically and served at: [https://moodle.docs.opencast.org/](https://moodle.docs.opencast.org/). The build is run daily.
